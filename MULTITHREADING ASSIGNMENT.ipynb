    "Certainly! Here's an explanation of the mentioned functions in the first-person plural:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `run()`: This function is used to define the behavior of a thread when it is executed. It should be overridden in a custom thread class to specify what the thread should do. When the thread is started using the `start()` method, it internally calls the `run()` method. By customizing the `run()` method, we can specify the actions that the thread should perform when it runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `start()`: We use the `start()` method to initiate the execution of a thread. When we call this method on a Thread object, it internally invokes the `run()` method, which defines the thread's behavior. Starting a thread with `start()` is essential because it ensures that the thread runs concurrently with other threads and makes use of available CPU resources. Calling `run()` directly does not create a new thread but rather runs the function in the current thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `join()`: The `join()` method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution before proceeding with the rest of the program. When we call `join()` on a Thread object, the program will block and wait until that thread finishes its task. This is useful when you need the results or side effects of a thread's execution before continuing with the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `isAlive()`: The `isAlive()` function is employed to check whether a thread is currently running or has completed its execution. It returns a Boolean value, `True` if the thread is still active (running) and `False` if it has completed its task. This function is useful for determining the status of a thread, particularly when you want to perform actions based on the thread's state, like waiting for it to finish using `join()` when it's still active."

    "Advantages:\n",
    "1. **Improved Performance**: Multithreading allows us to execute multiple tasks concurrently, which can lead to better CPU utilization and faster execution of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Responsiveness**: With threads, we can keep certain parts of our program responsive, such as user interfaces, while performing background tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Sharing**: Threads can share data and resources more efficiently compared to separate processes, as they run within the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simplicity**: In some cases, multithreading can simplify the design of complex applications by breaking them into smaller, manageable threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1. **Complexity**: Multithreading introduces complexity, such as race conditions and deadlocks, which can be challenging to debug and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Thread Safety**: Ensuring data integrity in a multithreaded environment requires careful synchronization, leading to additional code complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limited CPU Utilization**: Multithreading might not fully utilize multiple CPU cores if a program's tasks are not truly parallelizable.\n",
